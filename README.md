## Full-Stack-Take-Home-2-Backend

#### Installation instructions

Install Node.js where you want to run this Backend application.  Clone this project from GitHub to local directory.  In terminal, change directory to the installation directory and run command 'npm install' which will install all dependencies from package.json file.  

#### Running instructions

From the installation directory execute command 'npm start'.  From browser, navigate to 'http://localhost:3006' and follow instructions from screen.

**TASK**

- Create a node app that implements a set of REST APIs allowing CRUD functionality for an employee resource.
- Add a front end component of your choosing. The front end component should:
  - Show a list of the existing employees
  - Include a way to create a new employee using the POST API

**Expected Time**

This exercise is expected to take about 4-5 hours total, over the course of 2-3 days.

**Submission Instructions**

Post your solution to a public repository on [Github](https://github.com/). Send the repository URL back to the same person who sent you these instructions.

**Additional Guidance**

Persistent storage is not necessary, just use an in memory object to track employee records.

Use any npm modules you find useful.

**Expected Endpoints**

POST http://localhost:3000/api/employees

- Create a new record using a randomly generated value as the unique identifier (i.e. _id field).  Validate that the following fields are included in the POST body and have the right type/format as posted below:
    - firstName (String)
    - lastName (String)
    - hireDate (YYYY-MM-DD format must be in the past)
    - role (String) - must be one of the following (case-insensitive):
        - CEO (can only be one of these)
        - VP
        - MANAGER
        - LACKEY

    - In addition to the fields included in the POST body, include two fields in each new record that are populated by different external APIs.  For example, a favorite joke and a favorite quote, or a favorite joke and a second favorite joke.  As long as the two external APIs are different.
        - Possible API endpoints:
